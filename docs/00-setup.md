# 00 — Setup

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.12
- PostgreSQL (local) for naive-agent and worker-agents
- Redis or Valkey (local) for worker-agents
- A [Render](https://render.com) account for deploys
- *(optional)* `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` — without one, the agent
  uses a deterministic **mock** model so everything still runs

## Install

```sh
git clone <this repo>
cd workflow-agents-workshop
npm install            # installs every workspace
```

## Local services

```sh
# Postgres
createdb agents_workshop
# or point DATABASE_URL at any Postgres you have

# Redis / Valkey (worker-agents only)
redis-server &
# or: docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
```

## Environment

Each app reads a `.env` in its own folder. Start from the root example:

```sh
cp .env.example packages/naive-agent/.env
cp .env.example packages/worker-agents/.env
```

Key vars:

| Var | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | naive-agent, worker-agents | Postgres connection string |
| `REDIS_URL` | worker-agents | defaults to `redis://127.0.0.1:6379` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | all | optional; mock model if absent |
| `AGENT_MODEL=mock` | all | force the mock model even with a key |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | all | optional; raises GitHub rate limits |
| `PORT` | naive-agent, worker-agents web | defaults to 3000 |

## A demo PR
